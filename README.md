##Project Overview
Inventory_Scripts is a git repository to aggregate a number of scripts I've written, with the intent to make it easier to keep track of what's created and/ or running in any one of your (possibly) many AWS accounts... The scripts in this repo will be discussed below

### my_instances.sh 
This script displays all instances in the specified account (by specifying the profile to run against). 

### all_my_instances.sh 
This script displays all instances in all available accounts (by reading the credentials file and parsing the profiles to run against). 

### all_my_buckets.sh
This script displays all buckets in all available accounts (by reading the credentials file and parsing the profiles to run against).
